### Insertion Sort
- Insertion Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time.
- It is much like sorting playing cards in your hands.
- The idea is to take each element from the unsorted portion of the array and insert it into its correct position in the sorted portion of the array.

**Steps of the Insertion Sort Algorithm:**
- **Start with the second element** (since a single element is trivially sorted).
- Compare it with the elements before it in the sorted portion.
- Shift the larger elements to the right to make space for the current element.
- Insert the current element into its correct position in the sorted portion of the array.
- Repeat this process for all remaining elements in the array.
