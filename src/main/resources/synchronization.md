### Synchronization 

- Synchronization is the process of controlling access to shared resources by multiple threads in order to maintain data consistency and avoid race conditions.

### Why is Synchronization Required?

- In a multithreaded environment, multiple threads may try to modify a shared resource at the same time.
- This can lead to inconsistent data, also known as a race condition.
