### Synchronization Block Explanation

### 1. Code Explanation (Statement by Statement)

```java
package com.thread;

class BankAccountBlockSync {
    private int balance = 1000;

    void withdraw(String name, int amount) {
        System.out.println(name + " is trying to withdraw " + amount);
        synchronized (this) { // Synchronizing only critical section
            if (balance >= amount) {
                System.out.println(name + " is withdrawing " + amount);
                balance -= amount;
                System.out.println(name + " successfully withdrew. Remaining balance: " + balance);
            } else {
                System.out.println(name + " insufficient balance to withdraw " + amount);
            }
        }
    }
}

public class SyncBlock {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        BankAccountBlockSync account = new BankAccountBlockSync();

        Thread t1 = new Thread(() -> account.withdraw("Biswa", 800));
        Thread t2 = new Thread(() -> account.withdraw("Jit", 800));

        t1.start();
        t2.start();
    }
}
```

Defines a class `BankAccountBlockSync` representing a bank account with an initial balance of 1000.

```
void withdraw(String name, int amount) {
    System.out.println(name + " is trying to withdraw " + amount);
```

Defines a method `withdraw()` that attempts to withdraw a specified amount from the account.

```
synchronized (this) { // Synchronizing only critical section
```

Uses a **synchronized block** to ensure that only one thread can execute this section at a time, preventing race conditions.

```
if (balance >= amount) {
    System.out.println(name + " is withdrawing " + amount);
    balance -= amount;
    System.out.println(name + " successfully withdrew. Remaining balance: " + balance);
} else {
    System.out.println(name + " insufficient balance to withdraw " + amount);
}
```

- Checks if the balance is sufficient before withdrawing.
- If sufficient, the amount is deducted, and the new balance is printed.
- If insufficient, it prints an error message.

```java
public class SyncBlock {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
```

Defines the `SyncBlock` class with the `main` method, which is the entry point of the program.

```
BankAccountBlockSync account = new BankAccountBlockSync();
```

Creates a shared `BankAccountBlockSync` instance.

```
Thread t1 = new Thread(() -> account.withdraw("Biswa", 800));
Thread t2 = new Thread(() -> account.withdraw("Jit", 800));
```

Creates two threads, `t1` and `t2`, that attempt to withdraw money concurrently.

```
t1.start();
t2.start();
```

Starts both threads, which execute the `withdraw()` method simultaneously.

### 2. Understanding Synchronization Block

- Instead of synchronizing the entire method, only the critical section (balance check and withdrawal) is synchronized.
- This improves efficiency as other non-critical operations can run concurrently.

### 3. Thread Execution Scenario

1. `Biswa` tries to withdraw 800.
2. `Jit` tries to withdraw 800 at the same time.
3. Only one thread enters the synchronized block at a time.
4. If `Biswa` withdraws first, the remaining balance is 200, causing `Jit`'s withdrawal to fail.
5. If `Jit` gets access first, `Biswa`'s withdrawal fails due to insufficient balance.

### 4. Benefits of Synchronization Block

- Prevents race conditions when multiple threads access shared resources.
- Ensures only one thread modifies the critical section at a time.
- More efficient than synchronizing the entire method.

### Java Threads Without Synchonization Explanation

### 1. Code Explanation (Statement by Statement)

```java
package com.thread;
```

Defines a package named `com.thread`, which is a way to organize Java classes logically.

```java
class BankAccount {
    private int balance = 1000;

    void withdraw(String name, int amount) {
        if (balance >= amount) {
            System.out.println(name + " is withdrawing " + amount);
            balance -= amount;
            System.out.println(name + " successfully withdrew. Remaining balance: " + balance);
        } else {
            System.out.println(name + " insufficient balance to withdraw " + amount);
        }
    }
}
```

Defines a class `BankAccount` representing a simple bank account.

- The `balance` variable stores the available balance.
- The `withdraw()` method checks if the withdrawal amount is available.
- If sufficient balance exists, it deducts the amount and prints the remaining balance.
- Otherwise, it prints an insufficient balance message.

```java
public class WithoutSync {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
```

Defines the `WithoutSync` class with the `main` method, which is the entry point of the program.

```
BankAccount account = new BankAccount();
```

Creates an instance of `BankAccount`.

```
Thread t1 = new Thread(() -> account.withdraw("Biswa", 800));
Thread t2 = new Thread(() -> account.withdraw("Jit", 800));
```

Creates two threads representing two different users trying to withdraw money from the same account.

- `t1` attempts to withdraw 800 units for "Biswa".
- `t2` attempts to withdraw 800 units for "Jit".
- Since the initial balance is 1000, both withdrawals may lead to incorrect behavior due to the lack of synchronization.

```
t1.start();
t2.start();
```

Starts both threads, leading to **race conditions** if both withdraw operations overlap in execution.

### 2. Problem: Race Condition

Since there is no synchronization:

- Both threads may check the balance **simultaneously**, seeing 1000 as available.
- Both may proceed with withdrawal, leading to an **incorrect final balance**.
- Example incorrect output:
  ```
  Biswa is withdrawing 800
  Jit is withdrawing 800
  Biswa successfully withdrew. Remaining balance: 200
  Jit successfully withdrew. Remaining balance: -600 (Incorrect!)
  ```

### 3. Solution: Synchronization

To fix this issue, **synchronization** should be added:

```
synchronized void withdraw(String name, int amount) { ... }
```

or using a synchronized block:

```
void withdraw(String name, int amount) {
    synchronized (this) {
        // Critical Section
    }
}
```

By synchronizing, only one thread will execute the withdrawal at a time, ensuring correctness.

### Synchronized Instance Method in Java

### Introduction
- In Java, **synchronized instance methods** ensure that only one thread can execute a method on an object at a time. 
- This prevents race conditions and maintains data consistency.

- In this example, we implement a **bank account withdrawal** system where two threads attempt to withdraw money simultaneously.
- The `withdraw` method is synchronized to ensure only one thread can access it at a time.

---

### Code Explanation

### Java Code:
```java
package com.thread;

class BankAccountSync {
    private int balance = 1000;

    synchronized void withdraw(String name, int amount) { // Instance method synchronized
        if (balance >= amount) {
            System.out.println(name + " is withdrawing " + amount);
            balance -= amount;
            System.out.println(name + " successfully withdrew. Remaining balance: " + balance);
        } else {
            System.out.println(name + " insufficient balance to withdraw " + amount);
        }
    }
}

public class SyncInstanceMethod {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        BankAccountSync account = new BankAccountSync();

        Thread t1 = new Thread(() -> account.withdraw("Biswa", 800));
        Thread t2 = new Thread(() -> account.withdraw("Jit", 800));

        t1.start();
        t2.start();
    }
}
```

### Key Concepts

### 1. **Synchronized Instance Method**
- The `withdraw` method is **marked as `synchronized`**, meaning only one thread can execute it at a time for a given object (`account`).
- This prevents **race conditions** where multiple threads try to access and modify `balance` simultaneously.

### 2. **Race Condition Prevention**
- If two threads try to withdraw money simultaneously, synchronization ensures that only one completes its transaction before the other starts.
- Without synchronization, both threads might check the balance at the same time and both proceed with the withdrawal, leading to **incorrect deductions.**

### 3. **Thread Execution Order**
- Since `withdraw` is synchronized, when **one thread enters the method**, the other **must wait** until the first thread completes execution.
- This ensures **consistent balance updates.**

---

### Output
Since the balance starts at 1000, only one withdrawal of 800 should succeed. The other thread will get an **insufficient balance** message.

Example output:
```
Biswa is withdrawing 800
Biswa successfully withdrew. Remaining balance: 200
Jit insufficient balance to withdraw 800
```

Note: Depending on thread scheduling, the order of execution might vary.

### Comparison with Other Synchronization Approaches
| Approach                         | Description                                                                                |
|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Synchronized Instance Method** | Ensures only one thread at a time can execute the method on an object.                     |
| **Synchronized Block**           | Synchronizes only a portion of the method to improve efficiency.                           |
| **Static Synchronized Method**   | Locks at the class level, preventing multiple threads from executing on different objects. |

---

### Conclusion
- Using **synchronized instance methods** prevents race conditions by ensuring only one thread can modify shared data at a time.
- It provides **thread safety** but may reduce performance due to **increased waiting time**.
- If fine-grained control is needed, a **synchronized block** may be a better option.

This approach is widely used in **banking systems, multithreading applications, and concurrent data access scenarios.** 🚀

### Synchronized Static Methods in Java

### Introduction
In Java, synchronization is used to prevent race conditions when multiple threads access shared resources concurrently. One way to synchronize access to shared resources is by using **synchronized static methods**.

### Code Example
```java
package com.thread;

class Bank {
    private static int balance = 1000; // Shared resource

    static synchronized void withdraw(String name, int amount) { // Static method synchronized
        System.out.println(name + " trying to withdraw " + amount);
        if (balance >= amount) {
            System.out.println(name + " successfully withdrew " + amount);
            balance -= amount;
        } else {
            System.out.println(name + " failed to withdraw. Insufficient funds.");
        }
        System.out.println("Remaining balance: " + balance);
    }
}

public class StaticSyncExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread t1 = new Thread(() -> Bank.withdraw("Biswa", 800));
        Thread t2 = new Thread(() -> Bank.withdraw("Jit", 500));

        t1.start();
        t2.start();
    }
}
```

### Explanation
### 1. **What is a Synchronized Static Method?**
A **synchronized static method** ensures that only one thread at a time can execute the method at the class level. This means that even if multiple threads are accessing the method, they will be forced to execute it sequentially.

### 2. **Internal Working of Synchronized Static Methods**
- When a thread calls a `synchronized static` method, the **class-level lock (monitor lock on the `Class` object)** is acquired.
- Since static methods belong to the class rather than to individual instances, the lock is **associated with the `Class` object of the class (`Bank.class`)**.
- Other threads trying to invoke the same synchronized static method will be **blocked** until the lock is released.

### 3. **Step-by-Step Execution**
#### **Step 1:** Thread `t1` starts and calls `Bank.withdraw("Biswa", 800)`.
- It acquires the **class-level lock** on `Bank.class`.
- Checks if balance (`1000`) is sufficient.
- Withdraws `800`, updates balance to `200`.
- Releases the lock.

#### **Step 2:** Thread `t2` starts and calls `Bank.withdraw("Jit", 500)`.
- It tries to acquire the **class-level lock** but has to wait until `t1` releases it.
- Once the lock is released, `t2` acquires it.
- Checks if balance (`200`) is sufficient.
- Since `500 > 200`, withdrawal fails, and balance remains `200`.
- Lock is released.

### 4. **Key Observations**
- If synchronization was not used, `t1` and `t2` could have accessed `balance` **simultaneously**, leading to incorrect results due to race conditions.
- Since we used `synchronized static`, only **one thread** accesses the `withdraw()` method at a time, ensuring correctness.

### 5. **Difference Between Instance and Static Synchronization**
| Feature    | Synchronized Instance Method    | Synchronized Static Method                  |
|------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Lock Level | Object-level lock (`this`)      | Class-level lock (`Class` object)           |
| Applies to | Specific instance of the class  | Entire class (all instances share the lock) |
| Usage      | `synchronized void method() {}` | `static synchronized void method() {}`      |

---

### Conclusion
- **Synchronized static methods** ensure **thread safety** at the **class level**.
- They use the **class-level lock (`Class` object monitor lock)**, preventing multiple threads from executing them simultaneously.
- This mechanism is useful for shared static resources like **counters, logs, configuration settings, and banking transactions**.

---

### 🔥 **Best Practices**
- Avoid excessive synchronization to prevent performance bottlenecks.
- Consider using **Atomic variables (`AtomicInteger`)** for better performance when only atomic operations are needed.
- **Use static synchronization carefully** as it blocks all instances of the class.
