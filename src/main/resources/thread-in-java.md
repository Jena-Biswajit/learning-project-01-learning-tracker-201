### What is the role of cpu.

- The CPU is the brain of a computer.
- Containing all the circuitry needed to process input, store data, and output results.
- The CPU is constantly following instructions of computer programs that tell it which data to process and how to process it. 
- Without a CPU, we could not run programs on a computer.

### Inside the CPU

- At the hardware level, a CPU is an integrated circuit, also known as a chip.
- An integrated circuit "integrates" millions or billions of tiny electrical parts,arranging them into circuits and fitting them all into a compact box.
- It helps input and output devices to communicate with each other and perform their respective operations.

- ***Elements of a CPU*** : 
- Control Unit (CU).
- Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU).
- Registers.
- Cache.
- Bus Interface Unit (BIU).
- Instruction Decoder.
- Clock.
- Pipeline.
- Floating-Point Unit (FPU).

### Functions of a CPU

- ```Fetching Instructions:``` The CPU normally retrieves instructions from the computer’s memory in a specific order set by the ```programme counter```.
- It collects the instructions one at a time and gets them ready for processing.

- ```Decoding Instructions:``` The control unit of the CPU decodes the instructions after they have been fetched.
- 
- ```Executing Instructions:``` After decoding, the CPU carries out the required calculations, data manipulations, or control flow activities to carry out the instructions.
- Addition, subtraction, comparisons, and Boolean operations are only a few of the mathematical and logical operations that the arithmetic logic unit (ALU) is in charge of doing.

- ```Managing Registers:``` Operands, addresses, and other information needed for calculations are temporarily stored in these registers. Data transfer between registers and memory is controlled by the CPU.

- ```Controlling Program Flow:``` The programme counter and any conditionals or branching instructions determine the next instruction to be executed. 
- Because of this, the CPU may choose among various execution paths and make decisions.

- ```Handling Interrupts:``` Both internal and external events might cause interruptions, such as keyboards and timers.
- In order to respond to the interrupt, the CPU pauses the currently running process, saves its state, and then jumps to an interrupt handler code. 

- ```Managing Caches:``` Caches reduce memory access latency to boost performance by storing frequently used instructions and data.
- When the cache is full, the CPU decides which data to evict while still managing cache activities, which include fetching data from memory into the cache.

- ```Coordinating with Other System Components: ``` It manages the transmission of information and commands between various parts, guaranteeing proper synchronisation and communication.

- ```Arithmetic and Logic Operations: ``` The CPU performs basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

- ```Control Unit: ``` The CPU includes a control unit that coordinates and manages the execution of instructions.
- It controls the flow of data between the CPU, memory, and other peripherals.

- ```Virtual Memory Management:``` The CPU works in conjunction with the operating system to manage virtual memory, which allows processes to use more memory than physically available.
- It handles memory addressing, page table lookups, and swapping data between RAM and disk storage.

- ```I/O Operations:``` The CPU communicates with input and output devices, such as keyboards, mice, displays, and storage devices.
- It coordinates data transfers between these devices and the computer’s memory.
