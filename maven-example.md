### Maven
- Maven is a build automation tool used primarily for Java projects.
- It simplifies the process of managing project dependencies, compiling code, running tests, and packaging applications.
- Maven follows a convention-over-configuration approach, meaning it provides a standard structure for your projects to minimize 
 configuration overhead.

**Key Concepts:**
- **POM (Project Object Model):** A pom.xml file is the heart of a Maven project.
- It contains information about the project and configuration details for plugins and dependencies.

- **Dependencies:** Maven allows you to manage external libraries your project needs.
- Instead of manually downloading and managing jar files, Maven automatically downloads them from a central repository (Maven Central).

- **Build Lifecycle:** Maven defines a standard sequence of tasks (compile, test, package, deploy).
- It helps automate these processes.

**How Maven Works:**
- You define your projectâ€™s dependencies, build instructions, and plugins in the pom.xml file.

**Maven downloads any required libraries automatically.**
- It compiles the project and runs the tests defined in your project structure.
- It can also create JAR/WAR files for distribution.

**Benefits of Using Maven:**
- Dependency Management: Automatically handles downloading and updating dependencies.
- Project Standardization: Provides a standardized project structure.
- Automation: Automates compilation, testing, packaging, and deployment.
