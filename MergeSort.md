## Merge Sort
- Merge Sort is a divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that divides the array into two halves, recursively sorts each half,
  and then merges the two sorted halves into a single sorted array.
- It is efficient and has a predictable time complexity of O(nlogn), making it suitable for larger datasets.

**Steps of the Merge Sort Algorithm:**
- **Divide:** Split the array into two halves until each subarray contains only one element (which is trivially sorted).
- **Conquer:** Recursively sort each of the halves.
- **Combine:** Merge the two sorted halves back into a single sorted array.
